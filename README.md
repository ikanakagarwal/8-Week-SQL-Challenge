## 🎯 About the Challenge

I'm participating in the 8 Week SQL Challenge to level up my SQL and data storytelling skills.

Each case study is based on real-world business problems—ranging from restaurant sales to delivery logistics. I'm solving them using SQL and documenting:
- Clean SQL queries
- Business insights
- Key learnings

This is part of my journey to build a **portfolio that speaks for itself**.
